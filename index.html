### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because it was based off of the previous
    lab 3, which was done a couple weeks prior. Unlike before, we were able
    to type the arguments in the command line instead of using cin to take
    input from the user.
    
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because of how interesting the end result
    looked. We were basically programming a kntting machine in order to 
    create a design; we did so through the use of for-loops. There were some
    difficulties but it was a fun problem to solve.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 3 was a favorite because until then I never thought about
    programming an animation, even though we made a pattern in the previous
    lab. This project required to read the contents of an animation file,
    which I did by using ifstream. It was enjoyable to see that my
    program was able to run the animation.
